Historical study of the Brazilian coast begins in the late 1800s, including the Geological Commission of Brazil and the Challenger Expedition. Subsequent 20th Century research includes the work Tommasi (1958; 1970; 1999) and Bernasconi (1943; 1955; 1957; 1958), who contributed significantly to the inventory of sea stars in Brazil. But unfortunately, many of these publications have little or no characterization of the Brazilian specimens and poor illustrations, preventing further comparative studies and, consequently, increasing misidentification by inexperienced students and non-specialists. Within the country, there are also regional differences as research has historically been more concentrated in the subtropical and temperate regions (i.e. S and SE) than in the tropical region (i.e. N and NE). In the last 50 years, for example, only five papers contained descriptions of sea stars from the north and northeastern Brazil. Located on the northeast coast of Brazil, the Bahia State has the largest coastline of the country (~1,200 km; ~15% of the total coastline). Here, we will provide descriptions of adult and juvenile specimens from Bahia (including illustrations, holotype information, remarks) and an illustrated identification key to all Brazilian species to serve as baseline taxonomic data to improve future research on Brazilian Asteroidea.
