title: "Review of the genus _Narcissia_ Gray, 1840 (Echinodermata: Asteroidea:
  Ophidiasteridae): from morphology to taxonomy"
date: 2021-01-01T04:24:04.142Z
summary: "Since the taxonomic revision of the Ophidiasteridae by H.L. Clark
  (1921), in which 20 genera\rwere recognized as valid, several new genera and
  species were included in this family, and the\rboundaries between some of them
  became largely arbitrary. This also applies to _Narcissia_ Gray,\r1840, whose
  morphology and taxonomy are still very poorly understood today. The main
  goals\rof this research were: review the taxonomy of the genus _Narcissia_,
  throughout its range of\rdistribution, from morphological studies; redescribe
  and characterize, morphologically, _N_.\r_trigonaria_ Sladen, 1889 str. s;
  characterize, morphologically, _N_. _canariensis_ (d'Orbigny, 1839)\r and _N_.
  _ahearnae_ Pawson, 2007, the two valid species most similar to
  _N_.\r_trigonaria_; review the\r validity of _N_.\r_trigonaria_ var. _helenae_
  Mortensen, 1933; review the validity of the _N_. _gracilis\r malpeloensis_
  Downey, 1975."
