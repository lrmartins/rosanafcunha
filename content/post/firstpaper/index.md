It is with much happiness that I share with you all the first paper of my career! In this study, we talk about the sea stars collected during a research program ([ProTrindade](https://www.marinha.mil.br/secirm/sites/www.marinha.mil.br.secirm/files/publicacoes/protrindade/protrindade-10anos.pdf)) in Trindade and Martin Vaz, Brazil. We reported five new records to the archipelago, with _Copidaster lymani_ A.H. Clark, 1948 also being the first record of the species in the southwestern Atlantic. Please, check our publication out on the Zootaxa website ([Zootaxa](https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4742.1.2)) to know more about our results and to see the species' beautiful pictures (like these ones below)!Â
