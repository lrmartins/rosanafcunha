I was invited by Professor Dr. Walter Cerqueira to give a lecture to undergraduate students at the Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana ([UEFS](http://www.uefs.br/)), Bahia, Brazil. I talked about the Asteroidea Class and the research I have developed during my master's degree at the Museum of Zoology of the University of SÃ£o Paulo ([MZUSP](http://mz.usp.br/pt/pagina-inicial/)). The students were very interested and receptive, and thought my research on the sea stars amazing! I confess I was a little bit nervous in the beginning because it would be the first time I would give a talk to undergraduate students, but it turned out a wonderful experience for me!
