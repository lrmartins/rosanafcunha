I was invited by Professor Dr. Walter Cerqueira to give a lecture to undergraduate students at the Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana ([UEFS](http://www.uefs.br/)), Bahia, Brazil. I will talk a little about the Asteroidea Class and the research I have developed during my master's degree at the Museum of Zoology 
of the University of SÃ£o Paulo ([MZUSP](http://mz.usp.br/pt/pagina-inicial/)).
