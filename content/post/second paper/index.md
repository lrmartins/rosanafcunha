In this paper (monograph!) we provide illustrations and morphological descriptions of 18 sea stars species from Bahia, including ontogenetic and 
intraspecific variations, information on three poorly known species, a discussion of taxonomic issues, and an illustrated identification key to all 
Brazilian species (also in Portuguese as supplemental data). This work also includes the conservation status of all species, their anthropogenic uses, 
and biological data from local academic research that have never been published in a peer-reviewed journal before. I am so proud of this paper because 
it is the final result of my undergraduate research, the first research of my life! Please, check our publication out on the Zootaxa website ([Zootaxa]
