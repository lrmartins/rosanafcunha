During my Fellowship at the Smithsonian ([NMNH](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/)) I was approved as a Research Visitant at the Natural History Museum, UK ([NHM](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/)). There I analyzed the holotypes of two species of the genus _Narcissia_: _Narcissia canariensis_ and _Narcissia trigonaria_. Also, I studied other specimens of the genus that they have in their collection. The museum is magical, and I could not hold my tears on the first day I realized I was working inside that amazing institution! 

**P.S:** I could not leave the NHM without a picture with the famous Darwin statue!
