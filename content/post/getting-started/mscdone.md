title: Master’s Degree done!
---
---

Today I have presented my work, the results of 27 months of dedication and intense research! I have learned a lot during this time and I am very proud of my thesis! I am grateful to all the people who, directly or indirectly, have supported me during this journey at the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo.
