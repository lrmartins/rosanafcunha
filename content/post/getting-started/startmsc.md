title: The beginning of a new journey
---
---

Today I am starting my master's at the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo ([MZUSP](https://www.mz.usp.br)). It is a mixture of feelings: joy, fear, homesickness, 
but mainly an enormous desire to carry out a beautiful research and increase our knowledge about sea stars. I know the "road" is long, but I am sure that I will do my best. I hope I can write a high-grade thesis in the end... Wish me good luck!
