title: The beginning of a new journey
---
---

"Today I am starting my master's at the Museum of Zoology of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. It is a mixture of feelings: joy, fear, homesickness, 
but mainly an enormous desire to carry out a beautiful research and increase our knowledge about the sea stars. I know the "road" is long, but I am 
sure that I will do my best, and I hope I do a good job... Wish me luck!"
