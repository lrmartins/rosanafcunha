title: 3rd Graduate Meeting at the MZUSP
---
---

Every year, at the Museum of Zoology of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, the graduate students are invited to present their research project for all the museum's community! It is a great opportunity to show your partial discoveries if you are still developing your study, or present your final results of your M.Sc. or PhD. My poster turn out so beautiful!
