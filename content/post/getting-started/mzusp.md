title: Graduate Meeting at the MZUSP
---
---

Every year, at the Museum of Zoology of the University of SÃ£o Paulo ([MZUSP](https://www.mz.usp.br)), the graduate students are invited to present their research projects to all the museum's community! It is a great opportunity to show your partial discoveries if you are still developing your study, or present the final results of your M.Sc. or PhD. My poster turned out so beautiful!
