It is with much happiness in my heart that I let you all know that today I start my Fellowship at the NMNH – Smithsonian Institution! I have submitted a research porpose to the Research Support Foundation of the São Paulo State, and they approved a 3-month sponsorship to develop part of my master's studies about the genus _Narcissia_ deposited at the NMNH's invertebrate collection. I am so excited about this new adventure. It will be a honnor to work in one of the most important museums of natural history in the world!
