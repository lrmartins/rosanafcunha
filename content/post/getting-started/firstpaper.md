It is with happiness that I share with you all the first paper of my career! In this study, we talk about the sea stars collected during a research program ([ProTrindade](https://www.marinha.mil.br/secirm/sites/www.marinha.mil.br.secirm/files/publicacoes/protrindade/protrindade-10anos.pdf)) in Trindade and Martin Vaz, Brazil. We reported five new records to the archipelago, with _Copidaster lymani_ A.H. Clark, 1948 also being the first record of the species in the southwestern Atlantic. Please, check the publication section out to know more about our results and to see the species' beautiful pictures (like these ones below)!Â
