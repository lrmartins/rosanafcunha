title: First paper out!
---
---

It is with happiness that I share with you the first paper of my career! In this research we talk about the sea stars collected during the project ProTrindade 
in Trindade and Martin Vaz, Brazil. We reported five new records to the archipelago, with _Copidaster lymani_ A. H. Clark, 1948 also being the first record of the species in 
the southwestern Atlantic. Please, check the publication section to know more about our results and see the beautiful pictures of the species (like these ones below)!
