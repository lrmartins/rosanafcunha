title: Fellowship at the National Museum of Natural History
---

---
It is with much joy in my heart that I let you all know that today I start my Fellowship at the NMNH – Smithsonian Institution! I have submitted a research porpose to the Research Support Foundation of the São Paulo State, and I have received a 3-month sponsorship to develop a part of my master's studies about the genus _Narcissia_ in their collection. I am so excited about this new adventure. It will be a honnor to work in one of the most important museum of natural history in the world!
