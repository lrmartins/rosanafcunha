title: Fellowship at the National Museum of Natural History
---

It is with much happiness in my heart that I let you all know that today I start my Fellowship at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution ([NMNH](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/))! I have submitted a research purpose to the Research Support Foundation of the São Paulo State ([FAPESP](https://fapesp.br/en/)), and they approved a 3-month sponsorship. The main goal of the project is to develop a morphological study of all the specimens of the genus _Narcissia_ deposited at the NMNH's marine invertebrate collection (around 270!). I am so excited about this new adventure. It will be an honor to work inside this prestigious museum and learn a lot from all these outstanding researchers around here!
