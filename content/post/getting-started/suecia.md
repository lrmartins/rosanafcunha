title: Volunteer job at the Swedish Museum of Natural History
---

---

During my time in Europe I have applied for a volunteer job position as an Assistant Collection Manager at the Swedish Museum of Natural History ([Naturhistoriska riksmuseet](https://www.nrm.se/en/16.html)). There, I worked inside the marine invertebrates collections, helping them with the identification of mollusks and sea stars, and curation tasks. It was a wonderful experience and I have met many incredible people that make this museum one of the most important research institutions in the world.
