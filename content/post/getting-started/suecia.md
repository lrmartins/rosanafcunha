title: Volunteer job at the Swedish Museum of Natural History
---

---

During my time in Europe I have applied for a volunter job position as an Assistant Collection Manager at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. There I worked inside the marine invertebrates collections, helping them with identification of molluscs and sea stars, and organization issues. It was a wonderful experience, and I have met many incredible people that make this museum one of the most important research institution in the world!
