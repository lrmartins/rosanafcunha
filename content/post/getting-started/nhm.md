title: Visiting researcher at the Natural History Museum, UK
---

---
During my Fellowship at the NMNH I was approved as a Research Visitant at the Natural History Museum, UK (NHM). There I analyzed the holotypes of two species of the genus _Narcissia_: _Narcissia canariensis_ and _Narcissia trigonaria_. Also, I studied other specimens of the genus that they have in their collection. The museum is magical, and I could not hold my tears in the first day I realized I was working inside that amazing institution! 

P.S: I could not leave the NHM without a picture with the famous Darwin statue!
