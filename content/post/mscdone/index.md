Today I have presented my work, the result of 27 months of dedication and intense research! I have learned a lot during this time and I am very proud 
of my thesis! I am grateful to all the people who, directly or indirectly, have supported me during this journey at the Museum of Zoology 
of the University of São Paulo ([MZUSP](http://mz.usp.br/pt/pagina-inicial/)).
