I am interested in understanding the biodiversity of Asteroidea. I have been working with the morphological taxonomy of sea stars (Echinodermata) since 2009, and recently I have obtained my Master Degree in Systematics, Animal Taxonomy and Biodiversity. My studies have been focused on Brazilian sea stars, some of which also occur in oceanic islands. I got my Bachelor's Degree and my Teacher Licensure in Biological Sciences at the Bahia Federal University, Brazil (UFBA) with exchange period at the Fairleigh Dickinson University, New Jersey, US; and my MSc at the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo (MZUSP), with exchange period at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) - Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C, US.
